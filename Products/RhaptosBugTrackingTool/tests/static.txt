Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosBugTrackingTool.interfaces.portal_bugtracking import portal_bugtracking as IBugTrackingTool
    >>> from Products.RhaptosBugTrackingTool.BugTrackingTool import BugTrackingTool
    >>> from zope.interface import Interface
    >>> verifyClass(Interface, BugTrackingTool)
    True
